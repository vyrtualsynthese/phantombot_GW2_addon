# Guild Wars 2 API Module
by Andreas "Nekres" G.
Update by Vyrtual Synthese

Hey GW2 streamers, I have made a plugin for the PhantomBot (phantombot.net) that connects in detail with the GW2 API.
This is a fork from https://github.com/PhantomBot/custom-modules/tree/master/guildwars2 to add some more wvw features.

 The API is purely for "viewing" ressources!

### !gw2 goldcounter - The gold counter display explained

The gold counter, or rather 'profit calculator', will be displayed in two lines.  

**Example:**  

10g 52s 70c - Your initial gold when starting the gold counter.  
+0g 00s 00c - Session profit calculated via losses/earnings updated every 5 minutes.  

**2. Example**  

8g 52s 70c  
-2g 00s 00c (You made a loss of -2g since your initial gold counter start.)  

**3. Example**  

13g 52s 70c  
+3g 00s 00c (You made a profit of +3g since your initial gold counter start.)  
  
(You can change the formatting via !gw2 coinsformat into ‘####.00,00g’.)  
  
(written to session_gold.txt for file monitoring by OBS/XSplit and so forth.)
